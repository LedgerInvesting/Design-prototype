## üö® CRITICAL: Page Creation Rules
**SUPER IMPORTANT - WHEN CREATING ANY NEW PAGE:**

### **üìñ ALWAYS READ NEW_PAGE_GUIDE.md FIRST**
**MANDATORY**: Before creating ANY new page or major component, you MUST read and follow `NEW_PAGE_GUIDE.md` AND `LIBRARY_USAGE.md`. These files contain critical patterns, rules, and examples that ensure consistency with the existing design system.

**Key requirements from NEW_PAGE_GUIDE.md:**
- **Layout Component Usage**: Always use `<Layout>` from `@design-library/pages` without extra padding containers
- **Navigation Integration**: Proper sidebar, breadcrumbs, and navigation utilities setup
- **Theme Integration**: Correct use of `useSemanticColors()` and semantic color tokens
- **Component Standards**: Button variants, typography tokens, and spacing standards

**TEAM DEPENDENCY**: Other team members rely on consistent patterns. Following NEW_PAGE_GUIDE.md ensures anyone can maintain and extend the pages you create.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Design Token Usage Rules
**SUPER IMPORTANT - ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE RULES:**

### **üö® NEVER CREATE EXTERNAL ICONS OR TOKENS**
**CRITICAL RULE: ONLY USE DESIGN LIBRARY COMPONENTS, ICONS, AND TOKENS**

- **NEVER create custom SVG icons** - Always use icons from `@design-library/icons`
- **NEVER use external libraries** for icons, colors, typography, or spacing
- **NEVER hardcode colors, fonts, or spacing** - Always use design tokens
- **ALWAYS import from the design library**: components, icons, colors, typography, spacing, etc.
- **TEAM DEPENDENCY**: Other team members rely on consistent library usage and may not notice external additions

**Examples of FORBIDDEN practices:**
```tsx
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS - Custom SVG
<svg width="24" height="24">...</svg>

// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS - External icon library
import { Download } from 'react-icons'

// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS - Hardcoded colors
backgroundColor: '#ff0000'

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS - Use design library
import { DownloadMedium } from '@design-library/icons'
<DownloadMedium color={colors.theme.main} />
```

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL**: The library is designed for team use. When team members who don't know the library deeply use Claude, they depend on Claude only using approved design system elements. External additions break consistency and create maintenance issues.

### **Typography Tokens - NEVER Override**
- **ALWAYS use our typography tokens first**: `typography.styles.headlineH1`, `typography.styles.headlineH2`, `typography.styles.bodyM`, etc.
- **NEVER add custom font properties** like `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily` when using typography tokens
- **Example of CORRECT usage**:
  ```tsx
  <h2 style={{
    ...typography.styles.headlineH2,
    color: colors.blackAndWhite.black500,
    margin: '0 0 12px 0',
  }}>
  ```
- **Example of WRONG usage**:
  ```tsx
  <h2 style={{
    ...typography.styles.headlineH2,
    fontWeight: typography.fontWeight.regular, // ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
    fontSize: '32px', // ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
  }}>
  ```

### **When You Need Custom Styling**
- **ASK FIRST** before creating any custom typography, color, or spacing overrides
- **Use existing tokens** wherever possible
- **Only override** properties not covered by the token (like `margin`, `padding`, `color`)

### **Color and Theme Tokens**
- **ALWAYS use semantic colors**: `colors.theme.primary400`, `colors.blackAndWhite.black900`
- **NEVER use hardcoded colors** like `#000000` or `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
- **Use `useSemanticColors()` hook** in components for theme-aware styling

## IMPORTANT: File Structure & Local Server Setup

### üóÇÔ∏è TEMP FOLDER - VERY IMPORTANT
**CRITICAL: The project has a temp folder for shared images and files:**
```
E:\Ledger design library\temp\
```
- **Always check this folder for images/screenshots** when the user mentions adding images
- Contains project-related files like design mockups, alignment examples, and reference images
- Use this path when the user says "I added an image in our temp folder"

### Working Directory Structure
The project has this directory structure:
```
E:\Ledger design library\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                  # This context file (root level)

- **Contracts**: AI extraction, document processing
- **Marketplace**: Offerings, product listings

**Examples:**
- `ReportsTransactionManagement.tsx` ‚Üí `ReportsTransactionManagement`
- `AnalyticsValuationDashboard.tsx` ‚Üí `AnalyticsValuationDashboard`
- `ContractsAIExtraction.tsx` ‚Üí `ContractsAIExtraction`
- `MarketplaceOfferings.tsx` ‚Üí `MarketplaceOfferings`

**Current Pages:**

- **MarketplaceOfferings.tsx**: Marketplace offerings and product listings

**Usage:**
```bash
cd "E:\Ledger design library\pages"
npm run dev  # Start on http://localhost:5173
```

**Adding New Pages:**
1. **FIRST**: Read `NEW_PAGE_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive creation guidelines
2. **Follow naming convention**: Use `[BusinessSection][PageName].tsx` format
3. Create new `.tsx` files in `/pages` folder following the naming pattern
4. Import Layout component: `import { Layout } from '@design-library/pages'`
5. Use design tokens: `import { colors, typography } from '@design-library/tokens'`
6. Wrap content with Layout component for consistent navigation and responsive behavior
7. Add to App.tsx routing with proper page type
8. Update navigation utilities with new page type
9. Text selection will automatically adapt to current product theme via ThemeProvider integration
