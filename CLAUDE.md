# Ledger Design Library - Claude Context

## ðŸš¨ FIRST ACTION: Start Storybook Server
**IMMEDIATELY after reading this file, start the local server with this command:**
```bash
cd "E:\Ledger design library\design-library" && npm run storybook
```
This ensures you can view components and changes in real-time at http://localhost:6006/

## IMPORTANT: File Structure & Local Server Setup

### Working Directory Structure
The project has this directory structure:
```
E:\Ledger design library\
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                  # This context file (root level)
â”œâ”€â”€ COMPONENTS.md               # Detailed component documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ RECENT_WORK.md             # Work history and changelog
â”œâ”€â”€ STORYBOOK_STANDARDS.md     # Storybook guidelines and standards
â”œâ”€â”€ design-library/            # Main project folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Main package.json is HERE
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                   # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .storybook/            # Storybook config
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [all project files]
â””â”€â”€ backup-20250728/           # Backup folder
```

### Starting Local Server
**ALWAYS use this exact command to start Storybook:**
```bash
cd "E:\Ledger design library\design-library" && npm run storybook
```

The server will start on http://localhost:6006/ - navigation to the `design-library` subfolder is required because that's where the package.json file is located.

## Project Overview
This is a React design library built with TypeScript and Storybook, containing design tokens, components, and a comprehensive icon system extracted from Figma using MCP server integration.

## Current State
- **Design Tokens**: Complete color system including new black800, typography, spacing, and border radius from Figma
- **Components**: Button, InfoTooltip, Input, DatePicker, Dropdown, Selector, ButtonSelector, Status, Table, Card, FormTabs
- **Page Components**: 
  - **Layout**: Enhanced unified page component combining TopNav and Sidebar with optional tabs integration
  - **Sidebar** (220px width) with brand logos, expandable menu structure, custom inbox button with notification badge
  - **TopNav** with breadcrumb navigation, share button, user profile dropdown (updated to match Figma design)
  - **FormTabs**: 30px height step-based tabs with blue color variants and 2px spacing
- **Icons**: Complete 4-tier icon system with 106 total icons + 5 brand logos (includes DocumentTable, AddMedium, ReloadMedium, CloseMedium, CalculatorSmall, UploadSmall, ConfigSmall icons)
- **Enhanced Table System**: 
  - **Action Buttons**: Upload actions now feature light green styling (#C6FFC1 background, success green icon) to highlight primary actions
  - **Document Cells**: Enhanced with DocumentTable icons and configurable hover icons (download or config)
  - **Intelligent Column Sizing**: Automatic width optimization based on content length (< 11 chars = 150px)
  - **Comprehensive Storybook**: Action Buttons Showcase, Cell Types Showcase, and Intelligent Column Widths for easy testing
- **Global Styling**: Custom text selection color using design system's blue700 (#9ad5f7) applied across all pages
- **Responsive Design**: All page components feature mobile-first responsive design with consistent breakpoints
- **Storybook**: Comprehensive showcase with interactive controls for all components, running on localhost:6006 (or 6007 if port conflict)
- **External Testing Environment**: React development environment in `/pages` folder for testing real component integration
- **Static Assets**: Images stored in `/pages/public/` folder for proper Vercel deployment and serving
- **Enhanced Form System**: Complete NewTransactionForm with comprehensive dropdown options from real reinsurance data
