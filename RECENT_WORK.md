1. **Analytics Illustration Update**:
   - **File Replacement**: Updated `analytics_Illustration.png` from temp folder
   - **Format Change**: Switched from SVG to PNG format for better compatibility
   - **AnalyticsValuation.tsx**: Updated image source path accordingly

2. **Tooltip Positioning Crisis Resolution**:
   - **Root Cause**: Page transition animations using `transform: scale()` created new stacking contexts
   - **Affected Components**: TriangleTooltip in ValuationDashboard, hover modals in BDX upload
   - **Solution**: React Portal rendering to bypass parent transform inheritance

3. **Portal Rendering Implementation**:
   - **TriangleTooltip Fix**: Added `createPortal` to render tooltip to `document.body`
   - **BDX Upload Modals**: Fixed 4 hover modals (progress, error, success, attention)
   - **Positioning Adjustment**: Added +35px offset to position modals below status icons
   - **Hover Interaction**: Maintained proper mouse enter/leave behaviors

4. **Upload Success Animation System**:
   - **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of which month/type was just uploaded
   - **Smooth Transition**: "Add" button morphs into progress icon with scaling effects
   - **Animation States**: Intermediate scaling (0.8x) → Final bouncy scale (1.2x) → Normal (1x)
   - **Professional Easing**: Uses `cubic-bezier` curves for polished animations

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
// Portal rendering pattern implemented across all affected tooltips
{isVisible && typeof document !== 'undefined' && createPortal(
  <div style={{ position: 'fixed', ... }}>
    {/* tooltip content */}
  </div>,
  document.body
)}

// Upload animation state management
const [animatingCells, setAnimatingCells] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

// Animation sequence with proper timing
setTimeout(() => {
  setUploadedFiles(prev => new Set([...prev, fileKey]));
  setAnimatingCells(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    newSet.delete(fileKey);
    return newSet;
  });
}, 700); // Total animation duration
```

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/AnalyticsValuation.tsx` - Image source update
- `pages/ValuationDashboard.tsx` - TriangleTooltip portal fix
- `pages/BDXUpload.tsx` - Major updates: 4 modal portal fixes + upload animation
- `pages/public/analytics_Illustration.png` - New illustration file

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused imports after linter optimization
- **Dead Code Removal**: Eliminated redundant modal ref assignments
- **Animation Optimization**: Streamlined timeout logic for better performance
- **Portal Consistency**: Uniform portal rendering pattern across all components

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- **Immediate Feedback**: Upload success is instantly visible with clear visual indication
- **Spatial Awareness**: Tooltips appear below icons instead of covering them
- **Professional Polish**: Smooth, bouncy animations similar to page transitions
- **Problem Resolution**: Fixed "tooltips appearing in wrong spot" across all reported areas
